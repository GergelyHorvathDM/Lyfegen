If a patient does not meet the objective response criteria at 3 months as determined by RECIST 1.1 criteria, it impacts the payment outcomes, as only a portion of the outcome payment is made based on these criteria.\n\n3. **Patient Selection and Monitoring:** The program includes comprehensive biomarker monitoring throughout the treatment course. Additionally, there is a patient selection committee that can make determinations for borderline cases, potentially adjusting treatment plans based on individual patient responses.\n\n4. **Immune-related Adverse Event Management:** There is a protocol in place for managing immune-related adverse events, ensuring that patients who experience difficulties can receive the necessary medical adjustments or interventions.\n\nThese measures ensure that patients who are not responding as expected can be closely monitored and provided with alternative or additional treatment options as needed.\n\n---\nI focused on the specific protocols related to non-response within the program, aligning with your query about treatment response.
